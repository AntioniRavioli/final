        <h2>Genshin Impact Team Basics:</h2>
        <h3>Team Rotations:</h3>
        <p>You want to rotate through your team so you can apply all sorts of elements or damage towards the enemies. Each member of your team will have their own specific role and their roles will be explained now.</p>
        <h3>Main DPS:</h3>
        <p>Your Main DPS on your team is your on-field damage dealer. They are the characters that will be taking up the most time on field doing the majority of your team's damage.</p>
        <h3>Sub DPS:</h3>
        <p>Your Sub DPS characters are the characters that does damage off-field by using their skills or bursts. Their main role is to apply elemental reactions to boost their Main DPS's damage whilst doing their own damage as well.</p>      
        <h3>Support:</h3>
        <p>Your Support characters are usually the ones that heals or shields your other team members. Do not focus on their damage unless you have fully invested in their supporting potential.</p>
        <h2>Tip:</h2>
      <p>You only need 1 Main DPS, at least 1 Support, and at least 1 Sub-DPS. Please priotize building characters from Main DPS, Sub DPS, and Support in order.</p>

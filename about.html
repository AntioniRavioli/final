        <h1>About the Creator:</h1>
        <p>Hi! I'm Anthony Josh Legrama and I have been playing Genshin since the second half of 2021. When I first started playing Genshin, I was lost in how to make a successful team composition and how to build certain characters.</p>
        <p>In the beginning, I just gave my characters whichever loot I got from killing enemies and gave them to my characters not knowing what they do to them.</p>
        <img class="art" src = "images/artifact collection.jpg" alt="Artifact Collection">
        <p>As I kept playing and experimenting with different characters throughout the year, I was able to learn what was best for which character.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, I can just simply look at a character's kit and I can judge by myself which weapons and artifacts are good for that character. </p>

      <h1>So Why Make The Website?</h1>
      <p>I made this website so that NEW Genshin Impact players will have a better idea on how to build their characters and how they want to organize their team. </p>
      <p>Just like I said before, I had a hard time understanding what was great for certain characters. Each character has their own unique style, yet they provide similar values to a team composition.</p>
      <img class="roster" src = "images/roster.jpg" alt="Character Roster">
      <p>I want to provide NEW Genshin Impact players the information they need to get a head-start into having a solid account. The time and resin spent on items on this game is valuable as the maxing your resin will take hours.</p>
      <p>Learning how to spend your time and resin wisely will make it easier for Genshin Impact players to progress through building your characters, weapons, and artifacts much more smoothly.</p>
